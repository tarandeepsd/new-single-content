									<li>Shout allows third party sellers to list their products. Transactions are carried out on third party 	sites: the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these third party products is solely 	between buyer and seller. Shout is not a party to this contract nor assumes any responsibility 	arising out of or in connection with it nor is it the seller's agent. The seller is responsible for the 	sale of the products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in 	connection with the contract between the buyer and seller. Since we do not sell any product or 	deal displayed on our website, we cannot assume responsibility for:
									<ul class="lower-counter-list">
										<li>any retailer’s behaviour;</li>
										<li>any problem related to the sale of products by retailers;</li>
										<li>quality of the products;</li>
										<li>products' conformity with any law or regulations;</li>
										<li>unavailability of products;</li>
										<li>any difference between the products' price published on our website and those actually 		charged by retailers on their websites;</li>
										<li>any problem related to shipping and/or delivery of products bought via a Shout link.</li>
									</ul>

Shout does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, 	and content of all of these or any other third parties. Your relationship with any merchant you 	contact through this site is solely between You and the merchant. You agree not to hold Shout 	liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any business conducted with 	our merchants or as the result of the content provided by such merchants through the Site. You 	should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.</li>
							 <li> The Shout website contain lots of information provided by third party sellers, SHout users and 	other content providers. Despite our efforts to be accurate, we don't guarantee:
							 <ul class="lower-counter-list">

You shall be responsible for transmitting all payments due 	on the terms agreed with any third party provider or distributor.</li>
							 <li>We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the Shout Services will be uninterrupted and 	that transmissions will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be 	guaranteed. Also, your access to Shout Services may also be occasionally suspended or 	restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services. We 	will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such suspension or restriction. </li>
							 <li>We reserve the right to discontinue or alter any or all of our website services, and to stop publishing our website and/or newsletter, at any time in our sole discretion without notice or explanation; and save to the extent expressly provided otherwise in these terms and conditions, you will not be entitled to any compensation or other payment upon the discontinuance or alteration of any website services, or if we stop publishing the website. </li>

							 <li class="title-blueTxt">Limitations and exclusions of liability
                               	<ol>
									<li> Nothing in these terms and conditions will:
									<ul class="lower-counter-list">
										<li> limit or exclude any liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence;</li>
										<li> limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;</li>
										<li>limit any liabilities in any way that is not permitted under applicable law; or</li>
										<li> exclude any liabilities that may not be excluded under applicable law.</li>
									</ul>
									</li>
									
									<li>The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Section 12 and elsewhere in these terms and conditions: 
									<ul class="lower-counter-list">
										<li>are subject to Section 12.1; and</li>
										<li>govern all liabilities arising under these terms and conditions or relating to the subject 		matter of these terms and conditions, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort 			(including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty, except to the extent expressly 		provided otherwise in these terms and conditions.</li>
									</ul>
									</li>
									
									<li>To the extent that our website and the information and services on our website are provided 	free of charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature. </li>
									<li>We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any event or events beyond 	our reasonable control.</li>
									<li>We will not be liable to you in respect of any business losses, including (without limitation) loss of or damage to profits, income, revenue, use, production, anticipated savings, business, 	contracts, commercial opportunities or goodwill. </li>
									<li>We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss or corruption of any data, database or 	software.</li>
									<li>We will not be liable to you in respect of any special, indirect or consequential loss or damage</li>
									<li> We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under 	these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable 	control. </li>
									<li>Because millions of products are listed and many thousands of customer reviews and 	comments are 	hosted on Shout.eu, it is not possible for us to be aware of the contents of each 	product listed for sale, or each customer review or comment that is displayed. Accordingly, we 	operate on a "notice and action" basis. If you believe that any content on, or within a product advertised for sale on, the Shout.eu website contains a defamatory statement, please notify Shout immediately by completing and submitting a report using our “report” pop ups.  </li>
									<li>You accept that we have an interest in limiting the personal liability of our officers and 	employees and, having regard to that interest, you acknowledge that we are a limited liability 	entity; you agree that you will not bring any claim personally against our officers or employees 	in respect of any losses you suffer in connection with the website or these terms and conditions 	(this will not, of course, limit or exclude the liability of the limited liability entity itself for the acts 	and omissions of our officers and employees).</li>
